# Experiments

The experiments that were performed, related to Equalized Recovery, are contained in this government.

## Usage

For example, to run Experiment Set #13 (observer_comparison13.m) , while defining the 'verbosity','time_horizon','M1', and 'M2'.

```
results = observer_tests(13,{'verbosity,time_horizon,M1,M2'})
```

## Experiment List

13. The objective of this experiment is to design a finite horizon, affine estimator (fhae) that is robust against the possibility of 1 observation missing in the entire sequence of length T.
